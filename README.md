# Generating_Fibonacci_Sequence
Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This MATLAB script generates the first n terms of the Fibonacci sequence.

How to Use:

Run the Script:

Save the code as a .m file (e.g., fibonacci_sequence.m).
Open MATLAB and run the script by typing fibonacci_sequence in the Command Window and pressing Enter.
Customization:

Modify the value of n to generate a different number of Fibonacci terms.
Code Explanation:

Initialization:
n: Specifies the number of terms to be generated.
fibonacci_seq: Initializes an array to store the Fibonacci sequence. The first two terms are set to 0 and 1, respectively.
For Loop:
The for loop iterates from the third term to the n-th term.
In each iteration, the current Fibonacci number is calculated as the sum of the previous two Fibonacci numbers.
Output:
The disp function is used to display the generated Fibonacci sequence.
